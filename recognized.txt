flapping its wings can cause a storm

can grow into something huge. In life,
small choices can shape our future in
ways we do not expect. A kind word
ora small decision can change
everything. This idea is seen in history,
science, and daily life. It reminds us to
be careful with our actions. Even tiny
things matter. The butterfly effect
teaches that the world is connected in
ways we do not see.
